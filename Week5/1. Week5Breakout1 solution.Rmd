title: "Week 5 – Bayesian Inference Exercise"
---

Instructions: We will reuse the battery life data from Week 4. The data set represents battery life in mobile phones for two different types of batteries: NiCad and Li-Ion. The research question is whether the Li-Ion batteries (labelled as type 2 in the data set) offer a better battery life than the NiCads.

Read in the data in the CSV file from Week 4 (batterydata.r.csv) using the Import Data dialog in R-Studio. Once imported, the data should show in a View() window in the upper left pane of R-Studio.

```{r}
library(readr)
batterydata_r <- read_csv("~/Google Drive crowston@syr.edu/Courses/IST 772 Crowston/Week 4/batterydata.r.csv")
```

1.	Using R, display a boxplot that depicts the distribution of battery life (Time) comparing NiCad and Li-Ion batteries (Battery==1 vs. Battery==2).  

```{r}
with(batterydata_r, boxplot(Time~Battery))
```

Or a violin plot:

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(data=batterydata_r, aes(x=as.factor(Battery), y=Time)) + geom_violin()
```

2.	Write R code calculating the value of the “point estimate” of the mean difference in battery life between the two types of battery. 

```{r}
mean(batterydata_r$Time[batterydata_r$Battery == 1]) - mean(batterydata_r$Time[batterydata_r$Battery == 2])
```

For reference, here's the t-test results

```{r}
t.test(batterydata_r$Time[batterydata_r$Battery == 1], 
       batterydata_r$Time[batterydata_r$Battery == 2])
```

3.	Run the BEST procedure comparing the life of the two types of battery. If you don't have JAGS software installed on your computer and the BEST package loaded in R (as described in Chapter 5), you can use the website http://www.sumsar.net/best_online/ to run the BEST procedure on the data. For your convenience, the data are listed here to cut and paste into the boxes on the webpage:

Li-Ion:

```{r}
#install.packages("BEST")
library(BEST)
bestOut <- BESTmcmc(batterydata_r$Time[batterydata_r$Battery == 1], 
                    batterydata_r$Time[batterydata_r$Battery == 2])
bestOut
```

```{r}
plot(bestOut)
```

4.	What are the lower and upper limits of the highest density interval (HDI) for the difference in means? Explain what an HDI is. Hint: what can you say about the probability that the population value for the mean difference lies between the upper and lower limits of the HDI? 

```{r}
diff <- bestOut$mu1 - bestOut$mu2
quantile(diff, c(0.025, 0.5, 0.975))
```

5.	Does the HDI overlap with zero? What percentage of the estimates under the HDI curve is above zero? What implications does this have for the credibility of a non-zero difference in battery life between the two types of battery?

6.	The web page output shows “Density – SD Group 1” and “Density – SD Group 2” plots. You can also view these plots in R-Studio with plotAll(bestOut). For which type of battery does the life span seem to have greater variability in the population? 

```{r}
plotAll(bestOut)
```

7.	Based on the results of the Bayesian t-test, which battery do you prefer? 

Here's what's happening under the hood:
